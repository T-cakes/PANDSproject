# History of Fishers Iris Data Set

<i>The Fisher's Iris Data set</i> was first founded by the British Statitician, geneticist and academic: <i>Ronald Aylmer Fisher</i>.[[1]](#references)

In 1936 he wrote an article titled <i>The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems</i> in a journal called <i>Annals of Eugenics</i>.[[2]](#references)

In this article, he developed a linear function to differentiate various Iris species based on their Petal and Sepal lengths and widths. Those Iris species involve: Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor and Iris-Virginica.

# Detailing the Data Set

The data set that I used comes from the <i>University of California Irvine(UCI) Machine Learning Respository</i>[[3]](#references)

The data file itself did not detail the column names so I named them according to the websites[[3]](#references) detail as follows:

    1. Sepal Length
    2. Sepal Width
    3. Petal Length
    4. Petal Width
    5. Name

The data set contains 3 classes detailed by name with 50 instances each with those classes being[[3]](#references):

    1. Iris-Setosa
    2. Iris-Versicolor
    3. Iris-Virginica

# Analysis of Fishers Iris Data Set Using Python
The data analysis I have performed through python provides various statistical observations which are split up by the first four columns and then further split up by the classes.

The analysis provides the count of each data set

the mean of those specific values (e.g. Mean of Sepal Length of all Iris-Setosa etc.).

The Standard Deviation of data.

And the range of the data in 25% intervals.
