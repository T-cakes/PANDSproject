# Analysis of FIshers Iris Data using Python

The Fisher's Iris Data set was first founded by the British Statitician, geneticist and academic: Ronald Aylmer Fisher.[1]

In 1936 he wrote an article titled "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems" in a journal called "Annals of Eugenics.[2]

In this article, he developed a linear function to differentiate various Iris species based on their Petal and Sepal lengths and widths. Those Iris species involve: Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor and Iris-Virginica.

The data set that I used comes from the University of California Irvine(UCI) Machine Learning Respository[3]
The data file itself did not detail the column names so  I named them as follows:

1. Sepal Length
    2. Sepal Width
    3. Petal Length
    4. Petal Width
    5. Name
